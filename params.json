It was initially built as a demonstration application for a presentation we gave at [ReactConf 2014](http://reactconf.com/). We have decided to open source it so the community can benefit from our contribution.\r\n\r\nReactive Trader was written by the team at [Adaptive](http://weareadaptive.com), a consultancy that specialises in building real time trading systems. We have many years of experience in building trading systems for clients with highly demanding latency and reliability requirements. Over the years we have learnt quite a few lessons, and wanted to talk about and point to examples of how we solve technical problems related to real time delivery of messages.\r\n\r\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1256913/2470980/8e95e5c6-b01c-11e3-9311-cc17a7c1b191.png)\r\n\r\n... talking via Web Socket with ...\r\n\r\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1256913/2470993/d7f153ea-b01c-11e3-9c0c-ac8c8261299a.png)\r\n\r\nReactive Trader comes in different flavours (click on the link for a demo)\r\n \r\n - [WPF (ClickOnce)](https://reactivetrader.blob.core.windows.net/client/Adaptive.ReactiveTrader.application)\r\n - [HTML5](https://reactivetrader.azurewebsites.net/)\r\n - Windows Store App (...soon to be published!)\r\n - iOS native app (...soon to be published!)\r\n\r\n# Video and Podcast\r\n\r\nClick on the image below to watch the video on YouTube.

Lee Campbell, author of (Intro To Rx)[http://www.introtorx.com/], runs our Rx training course, (Practical Rx)[http://weareadaptive.com/training]. We still have places available at our next scheduled course in London, UK, on July 7th and 8th.
