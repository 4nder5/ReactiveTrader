# Overview

Reactive Trader is a client-server application demonstrating some of the problems needing to be dealt with when building reactive user interfaces. It was initially built as a demonstration app for a presentation we gave at [ReactConf 2014](http://reactconf.com/) and we have decided to open source it so the community can hopefully benefit. You may want to have a look at the [video of the talk](#video-and-podcast)
